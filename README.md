# ☕ Cafe Sales Data Analysis & Forecasting

## 📌 Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive data analysis and predictive modeling for a cafe's sales records. The goal is to transform raw transaction data into actionable business insights, identifying growth opportunities, and predicting future revenue trends.

## 📊 Key Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, correcting data types, and filtering out noise (e.g., `unknown` and `error` entries).
- **Trend Exploration:** Monthly and daily sales aggregation to identify peak performance periods.
- **Loss Analysis:** Quantifying the financial impact of unclassified data (Errors/Unknowns).
- **Product Performance:** Analyzing which items drive the most revenue vs. which ones have low turnover.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 🐍
- **Libraries:**
  - `Pandas` & `NumPy`: Data manipulation and cleaning.
  - `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn`: Data visualization and charting.
  - `Jupyter Notebook`: Interactive environment for analysis.

## 📈 Key Insights
- **Revenue Impact:** Identified a loss of approximately **$5,123** attributed to unidentifiable data (`error` and `unknown` items).
- **Seasonality:** Detected specific patterns in sales during certain months (e.g., February 2023 performance analysis).
- **Inventory Optimization:** Insights into which products (like Salads) have high-profit margins but low sales volume, suggesting a need for promotional strategies.
